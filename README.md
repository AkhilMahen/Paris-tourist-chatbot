# Paris-tourist-chatbot
A conversational AI that acts as a Parisian tourist guide, answering traveller questions on landmarks, museums, food, transport, safety, and hidden gems. The project builds a high-quality Q&amp;A dataset and a simple Python pipeline to generate, expand, and evaluate responses using the OpenAI API.
